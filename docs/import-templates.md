# Import Templates

To use already provided templates in your project, simply import the provided `sql` source file into your project's database.

The blog template is included with the product and can be found in the zip file you downloaded. Inside, you will find an `sql` file that you need to import into your database to set up the necessary tables and data for the blog functionality.

::: tip NOTE
Before proceeding, ensure that the `blocks`, `collections`, and `collection_fields` tables do not contain any existing row entries. This will help avoid potential ID conflicts during the import process and ensure a smooth integration.
