# Blocks

A block is a collection field that allows you to group your fields in a single place. It can then be used as a field in multiple collections. Thus reducing redundancy, and maintaining consistency across collections.

You can add fields in blocks just like you would in collection. You can even add nested blocks in the block's schema.
